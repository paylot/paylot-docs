Integration
===========

There are 2 ways to integrate Paylot into your web or mobile applications. 
These are as follows:

- **Paylot Inline:** This provides a Javascript library that you can include
  in any webpage to easily to use our payment widget with minimal code.

- **Paylot Standard:** This is necessary when you want a fully customized
  experience. It provides an API endpoint you can use to generate a wallet address,
  memo (BEP32 tokens) and the amount the customer is required to send.

1. Paylot Inline JS Client
--------------------------

Paylot inline javascript client offers a simple, secure and convenient
payment flow for web and mobile. It can be integrated with a line of
code thereby making it the easiest way to start accepting payments. It
also makes it possible to start and end the payment flow on the same
page, thus combating redirect fatigue.

Here is a sample code that calls Paylot and also handles outcome.

**NB:** Please, note that the key used is your merchant key. To get this
key, go to your merchant profile by clicking one of your businesses on
your dashboard @ https://paylot.co/dashboard and then clicking
profile on the sidebar.

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------+

**NB:** It is recommended that all wallet addresses are valid for a maximum of 15 minutes. Due to the volatility of the market, this is required to ensure that customers send the coins using the latest market rate. After 15 minutes, there's a probability that the transaction won't be picked up by us.

3. Webhook Notification (Optional)
----------------------------------

Once we receive the notification that a transaction is marked as sent, we sent a POST request to the callback URL you have specified.
Specifying a callback URL is not mandatory since the inline JS client provides a mechanism to notify you when we detect that the coins have been sent and also, you can achieve almost the same result using background processes to verify/confirm transactions.

You can specify a callback URL in 2 different ways. Although, the second option overrides the first.

- **Business Settings:** You can specify the callback URL at your business profile page. This can be accessed by selecting a business and clicking **Profile** on the left menu.

- **Inline JS Client:** You can specify a callback URL while initializing a transaction on the inline JS client.

The body of the webhook notification request is a JSON object with the following parameters.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Parameter                         | Description                       |
